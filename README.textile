#000000book is an open repository for sharing and archiving motion
captured graffiti tags. Tags are saved as digital text files known
as GML (Graffiti Markup Language), which can be captured through
freely available software such as "Graffiti Analysis":http://graffitianalysis.com
(marker), "DustTag":http://graffitianalysis.com/iphone (iPhone),
"EyeWriter":http://eyewriter.org (eye capture), 
"Laser Tag":http://graffitiresearchlab.com/?page_id=76 (laser).
Graffiti writers are invited to capture and share their
own tags, and computer programmers are invited to create new
applications and visualizations of the resulting data. The project
aims to bring together two seemingly disparate communities that
share an interest hacking systems, whether found in code or in the
city.
